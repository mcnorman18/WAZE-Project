# Data Analytics Portfolio – Matthew Norman

Welcome to my data analytics portfolio! This repository highlights selected projects from my work and professional development, including the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate**. Each case study demonstrates my ability to work with data, apply statistical reasoning, build models, and communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences.

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 1. Waze Churn Prediction Project (Google ADA Certificate – Course 2)
**Goal:** Predict user churn for Waze by analyzing driving behavior, device usage, and engagement.  
**Highlights:**
- Built and inspected a pandas dataframe for 10,000+ users.  
- Identified ~700 missing churn labels and confirmed randomness.  
- Engineered behavioral features (km per drive, km per day, drives per day).  
- Found churn linked to **intense driving patterns** rather than device type.  
- Tools: **Python (pandas, numpy), Jupyter Notebooks**
